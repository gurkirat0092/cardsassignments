        <p>An Eclipse is a rare celestial event where the sun, moon, and Earth align perfectly, creating a moment of awe and wonder. During a solar eclipse, the moon passes between the Earth and the sun, casting a shadow on Earth and briefly turning day into night.</p>
        <p>This phenomenon has fascinated humanity for centuries, often viewed as a powerful and mystical occurrence.</p>
